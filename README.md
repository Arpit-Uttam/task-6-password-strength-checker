# password strength checker
-> Firstly, I take a weak password "Venom@09876" and check the strength of the password </br>
RESULT:</br>
It generates a 100% strong password, but many parameters show negative points, such as consecutive </br> lowercase numbers and consecutive letters. This indicates that this password is not strong enough for use. </br>

->In the second step, I take a strong random password "iRlZhXo<a^?0tM" </br>
RESULT:</br>
It shows all parameters positive and many exceptional, which means it is a 100% strong password
